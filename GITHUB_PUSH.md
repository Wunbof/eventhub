## Option 1: Create New GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `eventhub` (or any name you like)
3. **Description**: "EventHub - Full stack event management system"
4. **Visibility**: 
   - ✅ **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
   - Or Private (if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** check:
   - ❌ Add a README file (we already have one)
   - ❌ Add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ❌ Choose a license (optional)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you the repository URL. It will look like:
```
https://github.com/your-username/eventhub.git
```

**Copy this URL!**

## Option 2: Use Existing Repository

If you already have a repository, just provide the URL:
```
https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

---

## 🚀 After You Have the URL

Once you have your GitHub repository URL, I'll:
1. Add it as remote
2. Push all your code
3. Set up for Railway deployment

**Just provide me the GitHub repository URL!** 🎯
